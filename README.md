OMG, just watched Last Bullet and I'm like WHAAAT? 🤯 Seriously, who writes this stuff? Okay, so, first off, THAT ending?! I mean, why do movies always pull that dramatic twist? Just when I was settling down, BAM! 😅 But honestly, it's kind of why I love and hate these thrillers at the same time. You know what I mean, right? Like, give my heart a break!

Speaking of breaks, can we talk about that chase scene? I'm still in awe. How do they even film that without everyone breaking every bone in their body? 😂 Must be some insane stunt work. I gotta say tho, after the week I've had, it was perfect to just download the movie and get lost in it. So worth it.

> Okay, so, like, the characters... Umm, some were great but others? Meh. Felt like they googled how to create cliché movie characters during production, lol. Like, hello, every action flick ever! But I guess it wouldn't be the same guilty pleasure without them, right? 😂

And what was up with the main guy's dialogue? Half the time I was like, “Bro, just stop talking.” But at least I got a solid laugh out of it. Oh, and btw, I totally need to watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff I missed while I was too busy texting through the predictable bits. 🤦‍♂️

let movieEnd = mindBlown;

Anyway, I'm rambling now, I know. Just had to get this outta my system. Hit me up when you've seen it, and we can give it a proper roast. 😂 Until then, catch ya later! 🎬
